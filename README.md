# Thang's Notes

This page dedicates to my personal notes and does not reflect any community standard. 

In general, these notes are necessary for some rare situations but maybe helpless in almost others. 

It is fun if you can find something helpful here. In other cases, it's not my business.

> You cannot teach a man anything, you can only help him find it within himself.
