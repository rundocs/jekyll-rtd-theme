# Thang's Notes

This page dedicates to my personal notes and does not reflect any community standard.
In general, these notes are necessary in some rare stituations, but may helpless in almost others.
It is fun if you can find something help here. In other case, it's not my business.
>You cannot teach a man anything, you can only help him find it within himself.
