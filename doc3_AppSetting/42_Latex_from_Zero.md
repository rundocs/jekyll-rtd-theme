Export from Zotero to BibTeX: (Creating a .bib file)
To export all of the references in a certain library to BibTeX, click on the Actions drop-down menu in Zotero and select "Export Library..."
To export only certain references, select those references using control-clicks and shift-clicks, then right click one of them and select "Export Selected Items..."
From the dialog box that pops up, select the BibTeX format, and click OK.
Navigate to the directory where you are storing your manuscript (your .tex file), and save the file. This will generate a file in the appropriate format for BibTeX to read and create a bibliography from.

Auto-syncing from Zotero to BibTeX:
Auto-updating your .bib file when you make changes or additions to your Zotero Library is not available directly in Zotero. You can, however, install and enable a Zotero extension, Better BibTeX, to grant you these features. 
Once Better BibTeX is enabled, select the folder/library/items you wish to include in your .bib file as you would do in the basic export process described above.
In the export dialog box, you will now see many more options for your export format. Select the “Better BibTeX” option, and, to set up the autosync, make sure you also check the “Keep updated” box.
Click Ok, name your .bib file and save in the same location as your LaTeX file.
You can adjust or remove a .bib autosync of Zotero records at any time by going to your Zotero preferences and clicking on the Better BibTeX tab, followed by the Automatic Export tab.
For more detailed instructions on setting up your Zotero export, see the Zotero and BibTeX Quick Guide.
