# Parser
Forming the seven by three to four lies twelve. Pairing them to even produces a total of twenty four (24).
<!--end_excerpt-->
In our concept these process would present the total hours and days that stays fix in time cycle (24/7).

## Intro
In short, our concept is all about formation. An easy example, counting the total number of an individual duplicated in pair will become three. 
<!--end_excerpt-->

Pairing it to even with another four, the total will be seven (7).

ou may find our documentation explaining in detail of this formation which is based on a route of query and result that lies to an hexagonal configuration formed by their channels pairing.
Assuring you of our best intentions, there is no such thing similar with this kind of concept.

## Rating
The mapping covers also the nature of life object. In humans, each cell normally contains twenty-three pairs of chromosomes, for a total of forty-six. 
<!--end_excerpt-->
Twenty-two of these pairs, called autosomes, look the same in both males and females. Combine with the last pair, the sex chromosomes, which differ between males and females (females have two copies of the X chromosome, while males have one X and one Y chromosome), i

## Monitor
in our concept, employs by means of hexagonal array of twenty four (24). 
<!--end_excerpt-->
Going deeper into the process of DNA Replication in a chromosome, you may find a conjunction with the routes on all processes happen in our Mapping Diagram, where, at last, the routes generate their channels in hexagonal form that coherence with twelve to twelve by six to six in pairs running like hours in cycle (24).
Pairing the twelve with the associated group on the row of quantum then it will become a new cycle begin to run when all together is unifed and formed by means of twenty four (24).

## Team
One Nature is contributed to seven (7) by three fo four. On other side, combining one Nature, two Form, and three Route become six in total. Three by four complement one to six. Both are formed hexagonal.
<!--end_excerpt-->
As our mapping is generated in seven (7) kind of unique processes, so when the concept is implemented then its form will intent to acquire the optimal solution on every run to become unified as time cycle (24/7).

## Coding
The project is made in the purpose of getting a possibility to build an interface to generate an integrated info by setting the formation. 
<!--end_excerpt-->
On this project, the formation of three to four takes place to start. The three presents Hyip(1), Concept(2), and Program(3), while the four are Site Building(3), Monitoring System(2), Business Networking(3), and Project Mapping(4)

## Network
We have started our documentation of our mapping as shown here by diagram (available also in slide and video version) which begin with our Project Information in general. 
<!--end_excerpt-->
We will also introduce our initial Repository along with the Wiki. We are going to setup our Portal for all the 'eQ19 Script' that belong to the Project on GitHub, BitBucket, and SourceForge as well as our Script Portal on the most well-known programming like PHP, Python, Java, Go with possible also Node.js, Scala, Clojure, and Ruby.
