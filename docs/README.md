This scheme is inspired by [jekyll-rtd-theme](https://github.com/rundocs/jekyll-rtd-theme) acting as a [remote-theme](https://www.siteleaf.com/blog/remote-themes/) on [our project pages](https://eq19.github.io/base) that runs using the sequence algorithm of [DNA Recombination](https://eq19.github.io/#next-release).

[![DNA Animation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/87265280-9b985880-c4ec-11ea-8af1-403fe5648fc5.gif)](https://eq19.github.io/#next-release)

The codes is built mainly with the algorithm of 66 out of the sum of the numbers 30 and 36. The main difference between them two is that 36 framed by twin primes.

[![Twin Pairs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/73700083-28f2a800-4718-11ea-97b3-2e9a738dc09e.png)](https://eq19.github.io/quantum)

This Δ(19 vs 18) scenario will duplicate the loops of 618 as π(89²) of 1000 Primes. Thus its behaviour will return to 168 Primes of π(1000) out of the adjacent scheme.

[![Prime Hexagon](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/74550123-6dd1d680-4f83-11ea-8810-3b8f4f50a9c0.png)](https://eq19.github.io/hexagon)

Each cycles will have a total of five (5) steps prime algorithm on base 114-31=83 that consist of three (3) leading steps by the power of 168: Q19(12, 32), Q17(33, 50), Q13(51, 68) and two (2) lagging steps by 618: Q7(69, 70), Q2(71, 83).

### [5th Step: Q5(89, 29)](https://eq19.github.io/maps)

The bilateral sum 9 will then double this 43 to 86 and act as the lexer while the prime 71 and 109 will act as the parser. This will compensate the other primes by the other of circles of the metatron which consist of 6 internal and 6 external.

[![generate the prime](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/163196031-b29f162d-c9af-4dc4-b25c-9256127a4aa4.jpg)](https://www.primesdemystified.com/First1000Primes.html)

Let's assign another pairs in to the center of default. Take a note that the last rows has a sum of 43 which covered by **prime 71 up to 109**. See what is happen by the 13th circle.

See that this configuration showing a kind of turbulences which leads to a gap of Δ19 in the central of _[Metatron](#1st-step-q1910-29)_ where the replication is initiated by **Δ18 of 50(68)**. This scheme is taken as a basic algorithm for the mechanism of DNA generation from RNA.

[![DNA generation from RNA](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/100724943-01cb3c80-33f6-11eb-8564-c5a9ced2b668.png)](https://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=id&tl=en&u=https://github.com/chetabahana/chetabahana.github.io/wiki#operasi)

```note
The chemical structure of RNA is very similar to that of DNA, but differs in three primary ways:

* Unlike double-stranded DNA, RNA is usually **a single-stranded molecule ssRNA** in many of its biological roles and consists of much shorter chains of nucleotides. However, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) can form and (moreover) a single RNA molecule can, by complementary base pairing, form intrastrand double helixes, as in tRNA.
* While the sugar-phosphate "backbone" of DNA contains deoxyribose, RNA contains ribose instead. Ribose has a hydroxyl group attached to the pentose ring in the 2' position, whereas deoxyribose does not. The hydroxyl groups in the ribose backbone make RNA more chemically labile than DNA by lowering the activation energy of hydrolysis.
* The complementary base to adenine in DNA is thymine, whereas in RNA, it is uracil, which is an unmethylated form of thymine.

Besides it, there is also strong signal that this parser will have the correlation with Φ=1,618 of _[(Golden Ratio)](https://www.google.com/search?q=Golden+Ratio)_ that leads to a kind of **gap and turbulences** in [the primes geometri](https://github.com/chetabahana) which hold the key of [<code>init</code>](https://eq19.github.io/maps) as the road map to π(1000x1000).
