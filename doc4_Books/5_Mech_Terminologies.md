## Toughness vs Resilience

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-22c1efc79288fc85d2cee45b8cc5ebcd)

- **Toughness** is the ability of a material to absorb energy and plastically deform without fracturing. Other definition, is the amount of energy per unit volume that a material can absorb before rupturing.

$$ Toughness = \frac{energy} {volume} = \int_0^{\epsilon_{rupture}} $$

- To be tough, a material must be both strong (high UTS) and ductile.
