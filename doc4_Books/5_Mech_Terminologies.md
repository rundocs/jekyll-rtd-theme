# Some Terminologies in Mechanics

## Toughness vs Resilience

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-22c1efc79288fc85d2cee45b8cc5ebcd)

- **Toughness** is the ability of a material to absorb energy and plastically deform without fracturing. Other definition, is the amount of energy per unit volume that a material can absorb before rupturing. It is the energy of mechanical deformation per unit volume prior to fracture.

$$ Toughness = \frac{energy} {volume} = \int_0^{\epsilon_{rupture}} \sigma d\epsilon $$

- To be tough, a material must be both strong (high UTS) and ductile. Eg., brittle materials (like ceramics) that are strong but with limited ductility are not tough; conversely, very ductile materials with low strengths are also not tough.
- If the upper limit of integration up to the yield point is restricted, the energy absorbed per unit volume is known as the **modulus of resilience**.
- NOTE, this toughness is DIFFERENCE with [fracture toughness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture_toughness), which describes load bearing capabilities of materials with flaws.
